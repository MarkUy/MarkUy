I'm a Software Developer, currently working at Lightspeed Commerce Inc.

<!--
I have three on-going side projects: [my blog](https://mark.zone), [timestamp.page](https://timestamp.page) and [skedible.com](https://skedible.com).
I love learning new things. Please let me know if you need help on a project. I would like to contribute.
